# [ECE 6504 Deep Learning for Perception][1]

## Homework 3

In this (short) homework, we'll implement Recurrent Neural Networks for
character-level language modeling in Python.

We've provided the Linux kernel dataset (`data/input.txt`) but you're free
to run experiments on a different dataset.

Download the starter code [here](https://github.com/batra-mlp-lab/VT-F15-ECE6504-HW3/archive/1.0.zip).

### Q1: Vanilla RNN (30 points)

Go through `rnn.ipynb` and implement the forward and backward pass
for a 'vanilla' RNN. Code to check gradients and sample from the
softmax distribution have already been provided. Implement beam search.

**Deliverables**

- Completed IPython notebook `rnn.ipynb`
    - Forward pass (10 points)
    - Backward pass (10 points)
    - Beam search (10 points)
